# Extra Features Added

I have added a few extra features on top of the minimum requirements, namely:

* The ability to select your AI engine of choice from the available OpenAI engines
* Saves previous prompt/response combinations on page reload
* Fully responsive application
* Made the prompt/response list scrollable once enough prompts have been entered to provide a better user experience for desktop users

Sidenote: I definitely could have made it look nicer, more responsive, and probably saved some time using a UI library such as MaterualUI, but I wanted to show that I do not need to rely on such libraries to build an application.
