# Extra Features Added

I have added a few extra features on top of the minimum requirements, namely:

* The ability to select your AI engine of choice from the available OpenAI engines
* Saves previous prompt/response combinations on page reload
* Fully responsive application
* Made the prompt/response list scrollable once enough prompts have been entered to provide a better user experience for desktop users

Sidenote: I used a UI library only for the login page simply because that was extra, I did not want to use it for actual page required because I wanted to show that I do not need to rely on a UI library, but I am also more than capable of using one, if needed. Also if, for whatever reason, you need to logout I have an idle timer logout set up to log you out after 5-6 minutes of no mouse or keyboard activity.

# Important Usage Notes

I provided a README.pdf in my application as an extra attachment that explains a couple of important notes as well as provides the account to login as well as the api key. Once again I am sorry for these extra steps that my application requires.
